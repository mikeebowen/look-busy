# look-busy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrbgit/look-busy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrbgit/look-busy)

`sudo npm install -g look-busy` or `npm install -g look-busy` for Windows

##Usage

This package is just for fun, but I can always use more APIs to call, so if you have an API that puts out data or a method that writes something important looking(anything really, it just needs to look like the computer is hard at work solving something) send me a pull request on GitHub and help make us all look smarter.

After installing, to start looking busy go to your command line and enter `look-busy` to see data and other nonsense scrolling across your terminal.
