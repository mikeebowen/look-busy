# look-busy
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrbgit/look-busy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrbgit/look-busy)


`sudo npm install -g look-busy` or `npm install -g look-busy` for Windows

After installing, go to your console and start looking busy! This package is just for fun, but I can always use more APIs to call, so if you have an API that puts out data (anything really, it just needs to look like data) send me a pull request on GitHub and help make us all look smarter.

`look-busy` 		= scrolling api calls
`look-busy -r` 	= with rainbows
`look-busy -t` 	= with funky text
`look-busy -x` 	= funky rainbows
`look-busy -g` 	= green
`look-busy -i` 	= inverse colors

##To Do

+ Add more APIs
+ Add Docs
